Hi everyone! My name is Nate Quarderer and I'm a post-doc and Interim Director of Education at Earth Lab and ESIIL at the University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to coming to CU, I spent 10 years teaching physics, math, and environmental science at Northeast Iowa Community College. I did my PhD in Teaching & Learning (Science Education) at the University of Iowa where I studied how 8th graders come to know about climate change. Since coming to CU I've been involved with the Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) program where I've served as lead instructor since 2021. The ESIIL Stars internship is modeled after the ESDC and I'm excited to see what cool new things we are able to accomplish through this program.

When I'm not teaching I like to get outside with my dogg Bruce. I'll post some pics soon :smile:
