Hi everyone! My name is Nate Quarderer and I'm a post-doc and Interim Director of Education at Earth Lab and the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESIIL) at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**University of Colorado Boulder**</a>. Prior to coming to CU, I spent 10 years teaching physics, math, and environmental science at <a href="https://www.nicc.edu/" target="_blank">**Northeast Iowa Community College</a>. I did my PhD in Teaching & Learning (Science Education) at the University of Iowa where I studied <a href="https://iro.uiowa.edu/esploro/outputs/9983949497702771?institution=01IOWA_INST&skipUsageReporting=true&recordUsage=false" target="_blank">**how 8th graders come to know about climate change**</a>. Since coming to CU I've been involved with the <a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/edsc" target="_blank">**Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC)**</a> program where I've served as lead instructor since 2021. I'm now overseeing the <a href="https://esiil.org/esiil-stars" target="_blank">**ESIIL Stars**</a> internship, modeled after the ESDC. I'm excited to see what cool new things we are able to accomplish through this initiative.
